## Course Description
This course is designed to introduce students to the concepts and patterns of mobile programming, specifically focusing on Android and iOS platforms. The course covers a comprehensive overview of mobile application development, with an emphasis on setting up the development environments for Android and iOS, as well as implementing core application functionality. By the end of the course, students will gain familiarity with user interfaces, data management, memory handling, threading, and various services such as location-based services, sensors, and in-app purchases. Prior knowledge of Java is essential as the Advanced Programming course is a prerequisite for this course.
